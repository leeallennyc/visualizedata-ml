## Assignment 3: 
### Process Documentation located in: [This Folder](https://github.com/leeallennyc/visualizedata-ml/tree/master/ML_assignment_3/option_2/process)
#### Summary;
Using Unsupervised learning and specifically K-Means, cluster ~ 400 images of artwork from museum collections and galleries across several countries, curated and analyzed for inspiration and information on effective ways to visually communicate uncertainty, ambiguity, and vulnerability. The selected artworks were chosen for their unique ability to convey uncertainty using a range of approaches and techniques.
