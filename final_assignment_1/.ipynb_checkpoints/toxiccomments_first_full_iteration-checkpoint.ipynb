Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many \"\"the Nazis\"\" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the \"\"Nazis\"\" who came from \"\"Greenland or Mars\"\" or \"\"Nazi allies\"\". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. \"\"The German-led Nazi occupation\"\" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the \"\"General Government\"\" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. \n",

      "Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  \"\n",

However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

      "  The Half Barnstar Look, Love, about your work on the Children Act 1989, I can't say that it was perfect when you did your little bit of work on it—in fact, I only found you when I set out to hunt down a suspected hypothetical Troll or Vandal who I thought was deliberately (either that, or that he was incompetent, because his mother tongue wasn't \"\"English British English\"\") changing the tense of the verb or verbs into the past tense—anyway, just to let you know, in the English language, legislation, unless it was repealed in the entirety (entirely), (usually) uses the present tense (entirely, and throughout)—-still, I thank you for your sterling, steady and steadfast work, effort and dedication, because I think that I myself am probably now a little too old and am probably also a little to disabled and also barking to do half of what you did, without boring or depressing myself to death unless I were to start doing a bit of drink or drugs or sex or some or all of the above on the side! (Well, I wouldn't mind too much, though!) (P.S.: I myself am an amateur mature law student who alas would never actually graduate and never practise law because I am a bit of an invalid, both a bit blind and a bit barking mad. Still, if you live a bit \"\"Up North\"\" (of England), might perhaps meet up some time for a drink or two before Christmas, who knows?!) Anyway, TTFN, Sweetheart!    \"\n",

Sjo's 'method' appears to be that (sadly) typical mentality of deleting or reverting any new editor's referenced data in a manner which wholly contradicts Wiki policies, and especially against edits that actually conform to Wiki policies. Wikipedia is rapidly losing credibility as a Worldwide contribution site by having a select group of admins and editors who think they can act as judge, jury and God over anyone's edits that they might disagree with, whether or not it is a properly referenced and conform-to-policy.  The strap line about Wikipedia being a source that everyone can edit is becoming a pointless and hollow statement, when looking at the pattern of dictatorial and hypocritical editing policies applied by a core of prejudicial and arbitrary editors who seek to suppress any new input and then have the audacity to claim that the new editor is a troll. Sjo's arrogant reply to my question over whether  he should be reported for inconsistent application of Wiki policies sums it up. Editors like him are showing that Wikipedia and its concept of global participation is badly broken. Sad really, but there you go...
