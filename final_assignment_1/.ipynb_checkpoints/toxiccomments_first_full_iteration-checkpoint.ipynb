We are having a DSA Show sometime in May and we wanted to invite popluar desi singers to some and perform for our school. If anybody has any information about how I could contact Himesh Reshammiya or any other popular singer/group for that matter please email me back at dsa_cass@hotmail.com. Thank you, I really appreciate everyone's help!\n",

I also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation; certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production (which are also found in animation from other countries, whether the USA, Korea, or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market); this definition would exclude Miyazaki (who, indeed, excludes himself, unlike his western fans). Likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition.

If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  \n",

Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).

      "First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a \"\"Serb nationalist talking point\"\", a \"\"thinly veiled political advocacy\"\", and an \"\"unverified Serbian name claim\"\", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is \"\" tendentious & unreferenced\"\". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your \"\"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page\"\" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  \"\n",

Yes, you are certainly allowed to do whatever you want but some comments just pushed my buttons, which is why from time to time I exhibited infinite and random stupidity. Of course I am going to admit this — because I did. No, an arbitration will not be necessary because I am leaving the second We Belong Together finishes FAC and this is not a lie. Will I return? Maybe. I am not going to be present throughout late June–late September (I'll be studying elsewhere in the world). Therefore, I will not be making edits on Wikipedia during this time. However, following September, I might come back. Just do me this one favour: if you find out who I am (if I return), please don't tease me and do the things you have done; that was why I became uncivil and angered.

      "Oh noes. How will I ever recover from you not giving me any respect. Perhaps I'll reflect on the fact that a) you're a total moron who wouldn't know a true benefit to Wikipedia if it hit you in the face, and b) most, if not all, of what you know about me has been filtered through the grubby hands of Future Perfect, et al. They control what version of the truth you see here. The sad fact is, you don't have a fucking clue about what I've been doing. According to Future, I've been accusing Werieth of being a sock, without evidence. Which in his book is trolling/harassment. That's his version. Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll. I can't spell it out any more clearer than this - he never wanted Betacommand banned, he never wanted Werieth exposed. Just do the fucking math, or forever be his loyal subject, whose only true freedom is to lick his (jack) boots for the iron in the dirt. Seriously, if you're goal is to persuade me to not lift a finger when I figure out what Beta's next account name is, you're the one doing a 'stand up' job.   22:35\n",

I think the surgery did wonders in improving her life. However she experienced a Sudden Unexplained Death in epilepsy in January of 1998...about two years after her surgery. I believe the surgery had nothing to do with her death (it was two years later how could it be?) and that seriously, the surgery she had really did wonders for her. She was able to enjoy spending more time with us kids and less time worrying about if she was going to have a seizure any second. My mother's case was not hereditary. She has a very odd case. They were never sure EXACTLY what caused her to have epilepsy literally her entire life (well she was about 8 or 9 months old at the time of her first ever seizure) but my grandparents believe it has to do with a head injury at the time of her birth.

      " LOL! I am not sure anybody wants to get involved in that one. The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of \"\"The/the Beatles\"\" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to \"\"the Beatles\"\" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, \"\"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music.\"\" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a \"\"shot across the bow\"\" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to \"\"grow the fuck up\"\" and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff! I just can't believe this is happening on WP with all these rules and tough nuts. ) 99.251.125.65  \"\n",

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called \"\"Race laws\"\" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (\"\"they killed Jesus\"\"). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now move along to 1297 and \"\"bingo!\"\" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in \"\"ethnic cleansing\"\" by wholesale murder and mayhem.\n",

What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say \"\"me too\"\" (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  16:12, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

I do not advocate half-truths and lies spread by socialists and libertarians as part of their terrorist-sympathetic agenda.Yes, I know all about Hugo Chavez and his associations with Mahmud Ahmadinejad the holocaust denier and financier of terrorist Hezbollah.\"\"Social equality utopias, indeed\"\". Then why is it that Venezuela has among the largest collection of poor in South America?All this despite having boatloads of oil to dance over? At least India, despite all of it's problems, is democratic enough to progress past the black hole it had gotten itself into during the 60's and uplift the world's largest middle class into an information-based economy and a constantly improving standard of living. 20 years ago, there was no electricity in large parts of the northeastern India. Today, cell-towers have connected the entire region and facilities are being built everywhere from Imphal to Dispur.Of course, that's great for the terrorists, more targets, right?Communists in India have slaughtered countless people.
