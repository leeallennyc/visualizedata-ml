      "Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)\n",

I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  \n",

      "This is a non-trivial problem. Many perhaps most of the 5,000 editors with the highest edit count are likely to have diverse editing habits, I can think of two FA writers in that group, one who also has an awful lot of categorisation edits, another spends a lot of time on AWB. Any analysis of those 5,000 would need to work out the proportion of their edits that were of various types. Then there is the issue that you are not likely to have access to their deleted edits, and that a few of those editors have opted out of being analysed. But most importantly, the 5,000 accounts with the highest ever edit counts are not going to fully overlap with the currently most active 3,156. ''SpielChequers'' 12:48\"\n",

If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons.

      "Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. \n",

As I said, if this is a reliable source it is certainly worthy of inclusion, but there are limits to how far we can talk over the actual participants in the faith.  Let's be frank: if Messianic Jews called themselves Christians then there would be no problem, but if they don't then we are essentially engaging in a form of prejudice if we force the term on them.  If you were Catholic, would you like some Protestant insisting that you're not a Christian?  If you're protestant, would you like some Catholic asserting that you are a heretic?  These are not people who are trying to give up their Jewish heritage and become Christians (which would be tremendously easy to do, simply by converting); these are people who want to accept Christ while reaffirming their Jewishness.  They can be both or they can be neither or they can be something midway between, but it's not fair to them to force them into one category or another.  Ludwigs2 \n",

My concern with the RfC title could, of course, have been solved by retitling it, but that would not solve the issue that the discussion was focused on editor behavior rather than improvements to the article. Based on the comments to the AN/I where I requested review of my early close and to the talkpage discussion it spawned, I think it might have been better to retitle, collapse the sniping, and attempt to focus the discussion based on the few remaining comments.

As mentioned earlier, Forbes.com's blog post on Agostinelli isn't sourced with any data whatsoever; therefore, no one is in any position to decipher where they obtained their information. The financial journal (OGFJ) cites the $1 billion fund value in what would appear to be as reliable as one can get given the disclosure came in the context of a major financial transaction which would have implied due diligence. The Forbes.com blog source must therefore be treated accordingly and not taken as gospel or absolute. For all we know, it could be a well-orchestrated public relations bamboozling.

A short time later, Nona was signed to the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency. This was a short-lived stint, however, as the curvy Gaye battled bulimia for over three years. Eventually, Nona was forced to make a choice between her health and her modeling career.
