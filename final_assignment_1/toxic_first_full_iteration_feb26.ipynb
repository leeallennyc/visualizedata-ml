Saying that the Articles was the first constitution of the USA, and then providing a link to the (modern-day) United States, is misleading.

The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia. You are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up.

They are both people who were alive, but are inaccessible to the general public for the foreseeable future. He may or may not (depending on your definiton, or how you believe Kim Jong-Un lives like) be a recluse, but the only images that are made of him come from KCNA. And he isnt going to be giving selfies to his adoring fans anytime soon, or to anyone for that matter, much less to somebody who is willing to release a content of him for Free-Use or CC. So I dont understand how someone can come to the conclusion that the leader of North Korea is a figure who is not in a position inacessible to the genenral public. Are we supposed to wait until Kim Jong Un dies before we can get a fair-use provision? Or are we making conclusions that because somebody might be able to take a photograph of him in an unspecified future timeframe, fair-use is rendered incompatible with any content depicting him. Im not usually involved in license debates, but I seriously think this is already one of the worst world leader articles ive seen in a while and the lack of image is a huge part of it (he is currently the only world leader who is missing an image).\n",

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.

Whatever people think of me, I'm not the sort of idiot who goes around getting articles put up for AFD just so I can then say they should be kept.

You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.\n",

They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. \n",

But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant.

The Nazis were widely popular, and encountered no resistance from non Jews, non Communists, or any other Germans who were not exterminated by the Nazis.

The answer is simple: because she's African American and skin colors range all across the board in the African American community.

      "Hi Mihir. We all understand the complications you're going through. As I said here, an unacceptable burden has been placed on the CAs to make this poorly designed program work. We can be lenient when it comes to writing style, poor English, etc. These issues can be fixed gradually through copyediting, although I have to say that in some cases the English so poor (often resulting from copying text verbatim and then attempting to change individual words or verb tenses, or removing one or two phrases from the sequence) that the text is incomprehensible. Only editors who are subject specialists can copyedit such articles, thus greatly reducing the pool of editors who can make the repairs. Here's an example. The student had had multiple copyvio problems before and asked me to look at the new draft. I could confirm that blatant copyvio doesn't seem to be there anymore, but I simply cannot understand the content enough to fix the English or even comment on its accuracy.However we cannot be lenient on copyright violation, ever. The scale of the problem is now so large that it's now going to take literally months (and many editors) to find and remove it from articles edited by IEP students. The silver lining to this cloud is that we'll probably find and get rid of a lot of other copy vio that didn't come from IEP students. Hardwired control is one example I found today. The whole article is basically copied from Computer architecture and organization by John Patrick Hayes, and has been like this since at least 2008. Best,\n",

It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet 'miraculously' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.

The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. \n",
      "\n",
      "The openening sentences which say, \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year.\"\" should be changed to \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.\"\"   \n",

One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. \n",

For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.

I did not notice NickCT's comment until now but wanted to address it since we have already gone over this but people seem to forget or have to rattle it off everytime it comes up. I for one think \"\"massacre\"\" in some form should be mentioned in the lead. Unfortunately, the assertion that it is what \"\"people involved call it\"\" is contradicted by the following:\n",

That discussion will eventually come up again and any decision here will get scuttled by it (or the opposite). But it is clear that giving prominence to a very little used and POV dripping title in the lead is not acceptable to many editors without thoughtful balancing. Two easy options are presented to you. It is my hope that the word massacre is used in the lead but how to do it is a hurdle. And add on top of that that we still don't even have a good main title and it shows that this process has been broken since day 1. Day 1 was years ago.  03:16, 28\"\n",
