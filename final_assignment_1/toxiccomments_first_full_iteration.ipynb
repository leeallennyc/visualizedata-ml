      "\"See my note in the afd regarding Eduard Einstein.  I didn't say the article was too short, I said it's not noteworthy.  If you can convince me he's noteworthy, I'll be happy to withdraw.  But we don't include relatives of famous people and we don't include schizophrenics — why would we include a relative of a famous person who happened to have schizophrenia?  —  \n",
      "Please stick to the facts. Speculation about people under 30, snide comments about my edits, etc., don't help determine the merit of the Eduard Einstein article. BTW - if you don't like my edits - this is Wikipedia - you can improve them as you see fit. My writing skill has no bearing on EE's noteworthiness.  \n",
      "I didn't begin the speculation about Paris Hilton and her dumb dog.  It also wasn't me that claimed that the article was too short or that said that Eduard Einstein - whom I'd never even heard of before this - is more notable than Paris Hilton - who I'd heard of long before she even started getting on TV and movies.  I'm sorry that Paris Hilton is far more popular and interesting than Albert Einstein's son - even if it's only because Hilton's a filthy whore.  Ted Bundy is one of the lowest pieces of garbage to ever walk the earth and you'd get laughed off Wikipedia if you Afd'ed him.  I'm also sorry your edits to the Einstein article look like a pathetic attempt to make him look noteworthy.  If it wasn't in this situation, those edits would have been small one-line bulleted entries buried down in the references and external links section of the article, wouldn't they?  You might as well have written, \"\"he's really notable, really!  Please, please, please don't delete him!\"\"  And you've misconstrued almost everything about this, from why I even nominated the article in the first place to why I commented about your edits to the article.  I didn't say your edit style was bad - just where you put them.  —  \n",
      "OK - now that you've blown off your steam on my user page, I would encourage you, after you calm down, to go back and re-read what you wrote to me. If you want to come back later and have a civil discussion, I'll still be around.  \n",
      "I'm defending myself, not blowing off steam.  And, again, I'm not the one that started leaving demands to \"\"stick to the facts\"\" on anyone's talk page.  The circular nature of this bizarre exchange is pointless so this will be my last response.  —  \n",

But just like in The Matrix, few people could handle going down the rabbit hole. I think Trypto felt like you were attacking him for his arbcom opinion, and he's pretty sensitive about such things.  I think you're correct about Kudpung, but there are several differert ways to make your point without directly attacking Trypto. For example, you could have informed him that according to Kudpung's absurd recall criteria, Trypto is no longer allowed to participate in the recall process. Of course, criticizing Kudpung is like shooting fish in a barrel, so it's not very sporting. This is a guy who claimed, quite unbelievably, that the Wifione case was a good reason to keep the tools bundled and adminship as high a bar as possible in the very face of evidence that showed otherwise.  Wifione was able to get away with mischief for five years precisely because adminship is an elite process that protects and rallies around its own.  If the tools had been debundled, Wifione would have been desysopped at the first sign of trouble.  Trypto probably isn't aware of any of this or Kudpung's hilarious recall page, which is literally designed to prevent anyone from recalling him!  Go read it if you don't believe me.\n",

Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   \n",

      "\"::: Unfortunately Jafafa Hots appears to be ignorant of the facts and engages in petty-minded cynicism, feel free to do so as it is the preserve of the fool who cannot deal in rational debate. There are political connotations to using the term British Isles when describing the Republic of Ireland, we find it offensive, the law provides for it to be called the British & Irish Isles in light of the establishment of our free State in 1921 and independence in 1948. So such political connotations exist in calling people of the U.S.A. \"\"Americans\"\", the term exists because every other country in the Americas have their own identifiable description and you outlined some of those, this left the U.S.A. citizens to be dubbed \"\"Americans\"\" and it is not politically offensive nor is it legally incorrect. You go on to say by labelling us \"\"irishmen\"\", you \"\"mislabel\"\" (No such word, swot up on your English!!) half of us. The 4 million population of the Republic of Ireland overwhelmingly consider themselves Irish and of the 1.5 million in Northern Ireland, 700,000 consider themselves Irish leaving roughly 800,000 to consider themselves British. Now the last time I indulged in Mathematics, 800,000 did not strike me as half of 5million so come back to me when you have a little better grasp of the situation and stop making ignorant and idiotic comments on an issue that you have little or no real understanding of. Go back to important stuff like contributing to articles on college ice hockey, that's where I would suggest you belong my good man. Go make a difference.  \n",

They control what version of the truth you see here. The sad fact is, you don't have a fucking clue about what I've been doing. According to Future, I've been accusing Werieth of being a sock, without evidence. Which in his book is trolling/harassment. That's his version. Back in the real world - see all that evidence on Wikipediocracy - I've been trying to post that here from day one, because I came up with it. The reason why you can't see it anywhere here, is because corrupt bastards like Future know that for every Wikipedian who has a clue, there's plenty who are as retarded as you, and will believe him when he says it never existed, and that I'm a troll. I can't spell it out any more clearer than this - he never wanted Betacommand banned, he never wanted Werieth exposed. Just do the fucking math, or forever be his loyal subject, whose only true freedom is to lick his (jack) boots for the iron in the dirt.

However, it is absolutely absurd that the Five Moves are repeatedly removed by some mark-out fanboy who doesn't want anything negative said about Cena. The Five Moves are the basis of almost all criticism aimed at Cena, and therefore I have placed them back on the page, although obviously I have rephrased the wording so it is no longer biased against Cena and is entirely factual. Don't remove them again, as that is just stupid and goes against your whole 'no bias' attitude since you're biasing it in favour of Cena while also not letting people know the truth.

Same with Mily and Johansson.

And $2.5K for Christina and about 5 or 6 vag shots.  Why is one Johansson boob worth $66K and all of Christina's vag shots only worth $2.5K?  I can see why Olsteads pics are worth so much.  She is smoking hot.  But one boob is hardly worth $66K.  Anyways, it will be interesting to see how it all plays out.

      "\"WJ didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on \"\"We've Had Enough\"\" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support an entire family - not just those three children who aren't his biologically. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, \"\"Dangerous\"\", and it was all crap. 99% of Jackson's few remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album were crap, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Blood on the Dance Floor sold an incredibly low 6 million and it was rubbish. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, as many unfortunates found out. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire that disgusting pervert. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's mentally ill fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's career finished a decade ago. ( )\n",
