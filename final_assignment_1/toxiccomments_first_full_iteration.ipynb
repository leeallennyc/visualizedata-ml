It looks to me that I was correct:  At the time, Dodo was not responding, but that was NOT because he 'isn't at his computer'.  Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.  At the time (January 3), you got away with claiming that I was being 'impatient', because it was at least plausible that Dodo wasn't at his computer.

      "\"WJ didn't perform at the WMA because he can't sing at all anymore. That is the real reason he hasn't toured for a decade, along with his bankruptcy. Even his vocals on \"\"We've Had Enough\"\" four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with, certainly not comparable with the real King, Elvis Presley. Jackson has had financial problems since at least 1998 due to his declining sales and popularity, as well as his inactivity and having to support an entire family - not just those three children who aren't his biologically. In 2002 it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, and after losing those lawsuits in May 2003 he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of $400 million. Invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album, \"\"Dangerous\"\", and it was all crap. 99% of Jackson's few remaining fans regard it as his worst album. In 1989 Jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the King of Pop - meaningless, self-proclaimed title. He even planned to buy Graceland so he could demolish it, which certainly says far more about Jackson's megalomania than it does about Presley. Half the songs on the Dangerous album were crap, especially the unbelievably awful Heal the World, and it only sold 30 million copies on the strength of his previous three albums. Blood on the Dance Floor sold an incredibly low 6 million and it was rubbish. Yeah, WJ was unique all right, as many unfortunates found out. You must know some very sad 20-year-olds if they still admire that disgusting pervert. Anyway, most people know him as Wacko Jacko. Justin is the real King of Pop and like Eminem he just doesn't want to risk offending WJ's mentally ill fans. Justin will continue to perform, while Jackson's career finished a decade ago. ( )\n",

Telly's belief that he's only ever slept with virgins is probably false (unless he slept with a virgin who had contracted HIV some other way) and so is Jenny's belief that Telly was her only partner, or that in a culture of random drugged-out sex and casual rape anybody can even be sure who they've slept with.

Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing. But when a young boy claims incredible visions and revelations, comparable only to a handful of previous prophet's experiences, that is something else.  30 June 2005 00:45\n",

      "Do you ever discuss or seek consensus about your own massive changes you do to Pakistan, Islam or Muslim-related pages? The sole purpose of you being on the Wikipedia (under the light of your own Wikipedia \"\"edits\"\") IS to bully around (through using various Wikipedia venues and/or twisting, misinterpreting or even cherry-picking the Wikipedia guidelines.) others (specially those who don't agree with your cherry-picking from with-in the academic sources and propaganda) and create anti-Pakistan, anti-ISI, anti-Muslim and anti-Islam pages. You spend hours upon hours inserting your venom of bias, prejudice and hate into Pakistan, Muslim or Islam-related Wikipedia pages. Indeed, your history of \"\"editing\"\" is littered with bias, prejudice, hatred and hate towards the Pakistanis, Muslims and Islam. I hope I haven't put my foot on your Indian/British/Irish tail. If I have then please feel welcome to call all of your Wikipedia Admins and Check user buddies shouting \"\"\n",
      "\"\"Personal Attack\"\" which you do it too oftenly and quite proudly to others and still get away with it quite cleverly thanks to your Wikipedia Admin and Check user buddies. Thank you. 99.3.86.25 \"\n",

      "I am tired of the crap from all of you. I am done trying to keep this article readable and clean. You all can screw this article up all you want. I am tired of uptight power hungry ass holes not waiting till someoen is finished, just assuming that I have converted the entire article back to the original. they didn't bother to look and see that it's the same article, just cleaned up some with new information added. It's also bull shit that rider tips, a major part of the WDW monorail system, is removed, but the toy remained, BOTH are part of the WDW monorail experiance. But who cares about the content of the articles, as long as it looks good and meets some retarted code of style. Who cares that refrences that went no where were removed. lets block the guy for trying to give good refs to non borken links. Also odd that thre is a ref to a site that refs back to this article. Now we can't have a ref to a legit site with legit information just because it's a site by the editor, but we CAN have a ref to a site that send you in circles back to this article.  But as I said, this article has gone to hell. It is no longer a good resorce for information. I will wait and maybe in enough time trey, Kralizec!, Maelwys , and the rest will stop trying to own this article and will let other editors fix it up. Untill then this article will remain crap. Again I say, I feel sorry for anyone doing research trying to find info on the WDW monorail system and finding this article. So go have fun trashing this article. I'll kep an eye on it and maybe come back later.\n",

      "OK, So HBO is a joke to you. Burt Sugar, Dan Rapeal and ESPN are a joke to you. Roy Jones was a paper champion to you but this bum Zsolt Erdei is the legitimate champion? The guy who's never fought, let alone beat a decent fighter besides Gonzales, who Jones totally shut out. That makes allot of sense. Regardless. Bernard Hopkins won a light heavyweight title and that's the bottom line. He was the first Middleweight in history to jump to the light heavyweight division and win A title in 1 fight. Something Ray Robinson failed to do. That's a fact and should be included in this biography. Erdei and the lineal title is a JOKE. What good is the stupid title if none of these guys have to defend it against decent competition? You can't hide behind a lame WBO title fighting nobodies and tomato cans and expect to be considered champion. Erdei is a disgrace and so was Michalczewski. That's why Jones embarrassed the guy who beat him.\n",
