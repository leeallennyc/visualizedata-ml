The problem we are facing is the problem with pretty much any wikipedia discussion, it's way to freakin long. There is a reason commercials are only 60 seconds max, and that TV shows don't go on for 20 hours. Everyone has a limit as to how much time, concentration, and otherwise engery they can devote to reading random rantings posted by people they don't know on a project that they have no direct impact to that they edit for some nebulus reason of trying to make the world's largest free encyclopedia.

      "Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term \"\"Beat Generation\"\" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who \"\"is\"\" and \"\"isn't\"\" a \"\"beat.\"\"\n",

      "He discusses the origin of the term \"\"beat\"\" in \"\"hip language\"\" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with \"\"beatific\"\" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says \"\"articulated\"\" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.\n",

      "\"\"By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.\n",

Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer.\"\" etc.\"\n",

As for the Chinese case, Liu Bang and Xiang Yu were commoners, and their family names were used with their given names. I believe by 210BC family names were starting to be commonly used in China, and if you check the Historical Records (史记) by Sima Qian, he refers to them as \"\"Liu Bang\"\" and \"\"Xiang Yu\"\". On the other hand, the royal family of Qin were not commoners, and their family name (ancestral name, 姓) was never used. You can check the Historical Records of Sima Qian, he never writes \"\"Ying Ziying\"\", he always writes \"\"Ziying\"\" only. It is a modern anachronism to write \"\"Ying Ziying\"\".

CDBaby lists Babyblaue Seiten as a source, and an article exists about that review site in the German Wikipedia. It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them.

If you have, then you would know that claims of Fascism being anti-clerical is absurd (the position of individual anti-clerical self-professed Fascists is irrelevant to the ideology of Fascism itself). You would have to resort to conspiracy, as the would-be scholars have, and claim that Mussolini's ideology of Fascism was all a huge front and that he secretly was anti-Clerical and secretly considered anti-Clericalism intrinsic to Fascism. How convenient. And as for Darwinism, which was my other point, you won't find anything on that either. Mussolini never even stated anything about evolution (nor did Hitler, for that matter).

      "One of the things that bugs me about the writers who claim that the Midwest accent is the standard American accent is their fishbowl view. They view their own accent as the correct one. What do you think somebody from Georgia or Texas would think of that? Is this another \"\"to the victor goes the spoils\"\" from the Civil War? The north gets to have the \"\"correct\"\" accent? The population of southern speakers is barely a minority, I'd hate to be from Louisiana and hear some egomaniac from Iowa talk about his accent being the right one. It's like the woman who says the toilet seat should be down, even though 50% of the population uses it the other way, she thinks her way is the right way. Newscasters generally speak with a northern accent, I can attest to that, but they come from all over, and how many of them are deliberately trained to speak like a Midwesterner? I can't imagine such a thing. Would a newscaster from Albany NY or Seattle, or LA, or Connecticut, where people all have basically the standarn northern accent, need to change to some sort of cornfield Nebraska twang? Hell no. The Midwestern accent is not really typical anyway, I lived in Michigan for a year and people have an unusual accent there, not the typical newscaster accent. They say everything is \"\"the bomb,\"\" but they pronounce bomb as if it were spelled \"\"bahm.\"\" Their accent may be the bahm, but is NOT the standard way to pronounce things in journalism. I would say that of all the places in the USA that have the most neutral speach, that journalists would try to emulate, this region where I live beats out the Midwest for neutrality. Eastern upstate NY, from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse. Also Connecticut, they hae no trace of the New England weirdness that you see in Vermont or Maine, or most of Mass. And northwestern Mass has the Vermont accent. Very little of Mass is free of the weird New England thing. Worchester, forget it...very thick there. Probably the only accent-free part of Mass. is around Springfield, or southwestern Mass in general. That's like Connecticut, which is neutral. The Vermont accent is only found among the older people. Young kids in Vermont are not carrying this on at all. The old timers with their \"\"Pepperidge Faam Remembas\"\" accent with all the \"\"ayaah,\"\" well that was a Swedish accent and the grandchildren of the Swedes don't talk that way anymore. Not at all. As for the NYC accent, that only goes as far north as Peekskill unless you count all the transplanted NYC folks, especially after September 11, who moved upstate by the millions lately. As far north as Poughkeepsie, there are a good number of NYC folks that moved up, but the native Poughkeepsie people have the basic American accent, and the children of the NYC folks lose their accent in one generation. North or west of Albany, there are very few NYC transplants and no accent at all, except for the rednecks. And what can you do about the rednecks?  \"\n",

In the case of Bruker, the man was in violation of a judgment in 1980 which ordered him to appear before Rabbinical Authorities. If you look at the Greenberg article, he is absolutely opposed to the Court of Appeals judgment because Courts to date in other jurisdictions have ordered specific performance. Look at the Brett Case. This is why the Supreme Court case issue is the justiciability of a contract with religious overtones. Look at the CCLA case. The facts of the case that Ms. Bruker was able to conceive are important in terms of damages. The facts of the marriage have no import because the 1980 judgement which Mr. Marcovitz violated are after the marriage. And Ms. Bruker if you read some of the press has never stated that she was an Orthodox Jewess but Conservative. Again the issue of specific performance is related to ordering someone to do something that may be against his conscience. This conscience issue is also more often than not used as an excuse for violating an agreement.  And with the word conflict, it is inappropriate because it does not describe the issue. It should be the conflict between religious law and the doctrine of separation of church and state.\n",

      "Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.\n",
      "2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of \"\"no opinion\"\". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.\n",
      "3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  \"\n",

      "A gamecube game, P.N.03, or Product Number 03, sets the player as Venessa Schnieder, in the distant future. After C.A.M.S goes down (the main computer network on Mars), Venessa is sent in to clean up the mess. You only have one weapon, your suit, which is equipped wit ha hand shot, and a list of combo moves. Your main goal in each level is to get to a certain area, and/or destroy a certain objective. However, destroying enemies faster, without being hit, yields a higher combat point bonus, which is used to buy things like continues, or different suits. As you progress through the game, levels get longer, enemies get stronger, and your skills get better. The game has a pretty good future/techno soundtrack, and with all the bonus missions, it might take a while to complete.\n",

Wikipedia is meant for input by EVERYONE, including those who actually you know have knowledge about the subject at hand.

However, since a couple of people are incorrectly insisting on publishing the article using extremely incorrect information, one of the polls that Wikipedia does do would be a way to vitally inform those people that yes, in fact, living in America DOES tell you what people use words for in America!  There was no \"\"material\"\" removed from any article since that would be physically impossible since this is both the Internet, which has no physical manifestation, as well as an article which is written using words, and therefore also has no physical items or textiles involved.  In an article about a plant which has a section describing the plants usuage, it would of course be grossly improper to then instigate a debate about whether or not that usuage is scientific by writing a sentence which states whether or not such usuage is considered to \"\"work\"\" by one person or society or research paper or another.  The appropriate and valid scope of such an article would be things regarding the plant, including how people may use the plant, which means that that scope would not include any research or debate on methods of alternative medicine and whether or not they work.                       \n",

      "\"I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement \"\"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles\"\". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being \"\"bastardized\"\" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate \"\"sourced\"\" information. There is substantial \"\"factually accurate\"\" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an \"\"opposing view\"\". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were \"\"out-documented\"\" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.\n",

It's clear that you do not understand or appreciate the positive impact of the manual medicine, including joint manipulation.  But, I can tell you from my experience thus far, many \"\"intractable\"\" neurological and orthopaedic conditions that have been referred for surgery are simply neuromuscular imbalances that are very treatable by chiropractic care and manual therapies.  Maybe it's time to revisit the notion that DCs just \"\"crack backs\"\".\n",

Now, to clarify, I'm not against medications at all, however to fear manual therapy, including manipulation, is not supported by the research.  To call my profession a pseudoscience shows either a lack of awareness of chiropractic in 2008 or ignorance (take your pick).  In an evidence-based era, no health profession can escape the responsibility to demonstrate  clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness through research.  I suggest you start reading manual medicine journals so that you can better inform your colleagues of contemporary physical/manual medicine practice.\n",

      "PUBLISHED BY MICHAEL OLANICH, ON MARCH 31ST, 2015\n",
      "telemarketing2014\n",
      "\n",
      "ONE MONTH ago, we gave the Southern Poverty Law Center the benefit of the doubt concerning their dubious telemarketing practices. Today, with the release of their 2014 IRS Form 990 tax report, we cannot cover for their outright telemarketing scam any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the right is the SPLC’s IRS Form 990 for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fourth consecutive year, SPLC Founder Morris Dees, who bills himself as a “sound steward” of the donors’ money has deliberately scammed tens of thousands of well-meaning donors through his network of paid telemarketing rip-off artists.\n",
      "\n",
      "To wit, for the past four years Mr. Dees has continued his relationship with Grassroots Campaigns of Boston, Mass, despite the horrific hemorrhaging of donor dollars. Grassroots has cost the SPLC hundreds of thousands, and even millions of dollars each year for their fundraising efforts:\n",
      "\n",
      "2011:  -$212,214\n",
      "\n",
      "2012:  -$869,686\n",
      "\n",
      "2013: -$1,156,765\n",
      "\n",
      "2014:  -$1,130,680\n",
      "\n",
      "How in the world can Mr. Dees continue to deal with a company that has blatantly siphoned $3,369,345 donor-dollars out of his coffers over the past four years? These horrendous figures more than wipe out every dollar raised by his other telemarketing cronies, not that that amounted to all that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checking out Telefund, Inc. of Denver, we see that they raised $561,102 in the name of the SPLC  in 2014, and only pocketed $422,292 in fees, leaving the SPLC $138,811, or a whopping 25% of the donation money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did anyone tell the donors that Telefund was pocketing three quarters of their donor-dollars?\n",
      "\n",
      "But that’s all chump change compared to the experts at Harris Marketing group, who raised $213,694 in the name of the SPLC and “fighting hate,” and only pocketed $192,928, or a mere 90% of the money donated over the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, Morris Dees could not be happier with the results because Grassroots, Telefund and Harris all sold their information to him. For mere pennies on the dollar, Mr. Dees buys solid donor leads that he can feed into his own uber-efficient in-house fundraising machine at 100% profit down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "Best of all, it was the stupid donors who unwittingly paid to have their information sold to Mr. Dees. You really cannot beat that for “stewardship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dees will lose money on the deal this year, but it’s nothing compared to the tens of millions he stands to gain from these donors over the coming decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "But think about it. In 2014, Mo Dees paid $2,537,027 to third-party telemarketers to raise $1,979,272 in donor-dollars, meaning that the telemarketers kept every last dime they solicited over the phone in the name of the SPLC as well as an additional $557,755 out of the SPLC’s existing donor till\n",
      "\n",
      "THIS is “sound stewardship?”  At $100 dollars apiece “only” 25,370 of the 2014 donors got screwed out of their donations. A mere pittance. At $50 dollars a pop the number jumps to more than 50,000 suckers, and yet, Mo Dees calls this “sound stewardship?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Justify it anyway you want, but at least 25,000 well-meaning donors got screwed out of their money, just as they have for the past four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s time that the media and the IRS investigates the criminal scamming of the Southern Poverty Law Center. This is nothing less than blatant fraud. Selling the suckers one thing and giving them something far less.\n",

      "Even so, that does not imply that: Mexico could not possibly use any \"\"generous financial support\"\" to buy the arms, ammunition, or other war supplies for the very reason that the U.S. was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the Americas. To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.\n",

Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc.\n",
      "The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc).\n",
      "The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says \"\"I acknowledge the Way\"\" but these words are preceded by \"\"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me\"\".\n",
      "The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way.\n",
      "Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005.\n",
      "There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way.\n",
      "\"\"Factoid\"\" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967.\n",
      "The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest \"\"We're Approved\"\" Neocatechumenal propaganda.\n",
      "Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a \"\"Neocatechumenal spin\"\" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin.\n",
      "Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for \"\"granting a period of two years\"\", but Benedict XVI decisions about that \"\"widespread manner\"\" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not.\n",
      "\"\"Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one\"\": this valuable sentence tries to \"\"explain\"\" in Neocatechumenalspeak the \"\"decision of the Holy Father\"\" to require homily only from deacons and priests.\n",
      "On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation?

It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.\n",

The cut when the Doctor fires strongly implies that it is HE who shot the president (a fake-out that's the focus of the cliffhanger, in fact), and not the man in the crowd.  Also, it's later revealed that the scope on the Doctor's sniper rifle was tampered with.  I'll have to go and check, but it's always been my impression that the scope was tampered with in just such a way that when the Doctor attempted to fire on a would-be assassin in the crowd who was standing in just the right spot, his staser bolt would hit the president instead, in a perfect frame-job. 76.126.142.59\n",

Most such free African Americans were descended from unions between white women, servant or free, and African men, servant, free or enslaved. Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed. Heinegg found no nuclear families listed as Indian. In the 1790-1800 censuses, all free people of color were listed under \"\"other free\"\".[3]}}   \n",

Commemorating the centenary of the 1905 French law which established such a separation, the World Congress passed an important declaration which has been published in the International Humanist News of August 2005. The 1905 law establishes laicité, or the institutional Separation of Church and State, a defining characteristic of the French republic. Of seminal importance in the ongoing and permanent battle for the freedom of conscience, Laicité is under attack today.

      "Doc, I wonder if I could ask you for a comment on the following thread regarding the inclusion of information about Sellers' children: Talk:Peter Sellers#Inverse padding structure accentuates negative over positive? Following your comment further up the Sellers talk page I added in three anecdotes about his relations with his children. Ths inclusion of these details has raised a series of comments from  about them and about the personal information as a whole. As a broadly independent participant in this, could I ask your opinion? The article is now also at Peer Review and I am sure that if the balance is wrong it will be noted accordingly. Thanks very much if you have the time! Cheers -  (^ • @) \"\n",

A good example is the name Maurice.  Maurice Gibb, of the Bee Gees, pronounced his name the British way \"\"MOR-ris\"\".  Meanwhile, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire pronounces his name the American way, \"\"More-EES\"\".  I believe we should use the pronunciation that García Bernal himself personally uses, seeing as it is his name.  Therefore, the correct pronunciation would be \"\"gar-SI-a\"\".  After all, a person can choose however they want to pronounce their own name.  If he starts pronouncing his name the Spanish way \"\"gar-THi-a\"\" then I would agree that it is pronounced like that.  But until he changes the pronounciation himself, we must use HIS pronounciation.24.171.52.43  \"\n",

Could we have Study tech defines three barriers to study and purports a methodology of dealing with them?

The text logo might be used solely on the letterhead of the various team sports for all we know, but it certainly isn't used by the teams themselves, and thus doesn't serve the encyclopedic purpose of serving as an identifier for them. It's pretty disingenuous to suggest that any encyclopedia (other than one manipulated by a few people who simply enjoy being disruptive) would ever have an article about USC football, basketball, etc. without providing the primary logo used by those teams. But I guess that's why my professors laugh when anyone asks if using Wikipedia as a reliable source is acceptable, and thanks to people like the two I've dealt with here, I guess they'll always be laughing when students ask that question.

I'm rather interested what part of your statement did I misinterpreted? As for German collaborators - I do have evidence, that AK soldiers killed Lithuanians who were volunteers in  Lithuanian Wars of Independence, and had nothing to do with Nazi government. yes thay did kill family of one Policemen, and one Policemen - but killing family with little children is not the same as kill collaborator, don't you think?  But well, I might be overreacting, as I've read the Lithuanian commission material and it is quite difficult to remain calm after reading how, for example, AK did shoot a teacher in the school, holding her two years child in her hands, or stabbed a child lying in a cradle with a bayonet and held him in the air until he stopped moving, and many more facts of \"\"punishing collaborators\"\".

      "No,  and [ŋ'] are the same sound, and in phonetics no one uses [ŋ']. My point is that in the system used here, an fheall is transcribed with  (= conventional [n']) or  (= conventional [N']), while a ngeall is transcribed with  (= conventional [ŋ']), just as geall is transcribed with  (= conventional [g']), gheall with [j] or  (= conventional , ceann with [c] (= conventional [k']), and cheann with [ç] (= conventional [x']). Basically, the entire palatal series of IPA is used for the Irish \"\"slender velars\"\"; the article uses  rather than  for conventional [L'] for precisely this reason. I don't know whether /x/ is velar or uvular for most speakers, but I do know that all the sources I checked call it velar, so that's what the article says. Wikipedia has to reflect what's been published, not what readers and editors know in our hearts (and ears) to be true; cf. Wikipedia:Verifiability. Of course you have to define how you use your symbols, and I believe this article does, but for the sake of consistency with other phonology articles at Wikipedia, this article sticks to symbols that are official parts of the IPA. I do think there will be more readers familiar with IPA than with the traditional symbols of Irish philology, and for those readers who are more familiar with the latter, WP:IPA-ga, which is linked to at the top of this article, should clear up any confusion. —gr \"\n",

      "\n",
      "From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say \"\"I am copy 1\"\" and copy 2 will say \"\"I am copy 2\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  \"\n",

      "The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .\n",
      "\n",
      "In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, \"\"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away.\"\" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, \"\"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,\"\" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling \"\"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'\"\" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. \n",
      "Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of \"\"atheism and nihilist Communism.\"\" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

Perhaps if you took the time to review what I've had to deal with, you might understand why I am in the mood I am in. So far, my experience of Wikipedia has been anything but one of collaboration. At various times and by various people, I have been completely ignored, I have been told I am or I do things I provably do not, I have been told provably false things about what Wikipedia's rules supposedly say, and I have had to endure several people telling me all about a subject they clearly know absolutely nothing about, to the point where they are making quite ridiculous claims about how long it would take to write an article to their satisfaction (and obviously, the two of those are linked - people who know nothing about the subject or the media that covers it, aren't likely to have the first clue how long it would take to find and summarise that media, are they?). Apparently though, judging by the fact none of that has attracted any warnings for their conduct, I suppose all of this is completely normal here, and it's just me who is in the wrong for complaining about any of this by referring to people's actual names. So be it I guess. I'm struggling to see how me slowing down is going to change that. It appears to be hard-wired behaviour. I'm afraid that what you may or may not appreciate is that people like Dave are always going to feel insulted when the truth is told - when it's pointed out to them that the facts tell quite a different story about whether or not their claim to be a \"\"bus enthusiast\"\" are remotely true - or when it's pointed out that their claim to have \"\"literally\"\" found no results on Google doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny. Similarly, people like Charles, who are quite clearly only interested in trolling and annoying people, will always act like jerks whenever people follow up their 'reading advice' with questions which expose the fact that their advice appears to be based on nothing contained in the reading material at all. I'm really not sure why any of this needs to actually be raised at an administrator's 'noticeboard' before any notice of it is actually taken. Laziness/disinterest is all I can think of. There certainly seems to be a complete disinterest about the fact articles like NIBS are disappearing from Wikipedia based on absolutely nothing, certainly nothing that subject experts would agree was good reasoning. Still, this is all now being swept under the carpet because of the perfectly normal behaviour on Wikipedia - don't like what the other guy says? Ignore him and he'll go away. If he doesn't go away, complain loudly (and in a completely hypocritical manner in the case of Dave) in the hope someone gets rid of him for you.   \n",

      "For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that (User:Jerem43 was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely. \n",
      "\n",
      "There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow\n",

Virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the (usually rectangular) image. This is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase. The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way.

It did not indicate how or why the subject is notable, that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia.   Don't feel too badly; lots of people have a little trouble when creating their first article.  You might find it useful to read Your First Article for some good advice about starting to create articles on Wikipedia.  Two important rules of thumb are: Avoid  writing about yourself, your business, your family and friends, or your web page, and avoid writing about anything that hasn't been written about in reliable sources like books, newspapers, and magazines.  Anyway, don't be discouraged.  I've deleted the article you created, and feel free to ask me if you have any more questions.  If I've made a mistake, and this article really is about a subject that meets the notability criteria, then please let me know my leaving me a message and links to at least three newspaper articles, magazine articles, or books that have been written about the subject, and I'll be glad to undelete it, and even add the sources so no other patroller makes the same mistake.  - (talk · contribs) \"\n",

Equally importantly, having read parts of SF... though I do not myself agree with the characterization, I can see why others have gone so far as to call it a hate site. To be blunt, it's largely the chronicle of one person's persecution complex. As I said elsewhere, it verges on conspiracy theory in the kookiest sense. And then there is the painfully bad prose and screechy hysterical tone most of it is written in – it is simply not in any way a quality site and would not be even if I could credit the actual content.

      "1. Photo selection: On 3/15/07, I trimmed his four photos down to what I felt was the most representative one, even though trimming them to zero makes more common sense.  What did I do to balance out this trimming?  In the external links section, I added a link to Shankbone's gallery in Wiki Commons, which features all four pics.  Hence anyone can see all four photos with the click of a button.  \"\"Chivalry is truly not dead,\"\" you say to yourselves.  (I even left the gallery/centered HTML around it, so that it'd be positioned right in the center for all to see, not off to one side.)  What does Shankbone then do?  He adds his other three photos back, and slyly keeps the link which I had added to his pics at the Commons.  His reasoning is that \"\"One photograph in a gallery looks odd.\"\"  He could have simply reverted to the prior version, but he looked over my changes and then only kept the one change that benefited him. He keeps talking about how he wants to compromise and work with other users, but every chance he gets, he puts himself above all other considerations and still refuses to cooperate. Why would he have even made the Commons gallery unless he understood that his photos were not main-article-worthy?  He made the Commons gallery in the first place since he correctly reasoned that that was a better location for them.  Now he has told me he will do his best to have me blocked from editing this article any further.\n",

      "Back to what I previously brought up about him using this article for careerist purposes.  Why did he put his full name in the title of each of the .jpg files he uploaded?  (Roll your mouse over the photos, or attempt to download them to your hard drive, if you don't know what I'm talking about.)  That's unheard-of.  Unless, that is, he wants a lot of people to download them, and have his name conveniently attached in the file name, in case said downloaders ever want to contact the photographer and offer him $ to reprint them... \n",
      "\n",
      "How can he get as many people as possible to download them?  By making them as racy as possible, of course.  The point is: He could have posted clothed pictures without his name in them.

      "2. Slant of article: Tara Subkoff is a professional actress. She designs (or designed, since IOC is apparently defunct) clothes on the side, though actually all she does is modify existing ones with the help of a partner.  Her entire varied, and usually quite daring, 13-year film career is reduced to this line of text: \"\"She has acted in over a dozen movies.\"\" (Technically, that counts as zero descriptive lines of her actual roles or of accolades she has received.)  However, one fashion show of hers, which took place over maybe a 2-hour span at most, is represented by around two thirds of the descriptive text in this article.  Does that seem right to anyone?  I'd like for even one Wikipedia user to lay out for me how this is correct.  Someone who had never previously heard of Subkoff would think that the U.S. media had some sort of frenzy over this one show she put on, and that her acting is so subpar as to deserve approximately 0.0 to 0.5 words per film role.  (And 100% of the two \"\"references\"\" that he hastily added to this article are about this one-time event.)  Shankbone has consistently and subtly altered the emphasis of this article towards proving his point of view, at the expense of doing Subkoff's career justice.  In science, an experiment is never undertaken with the intent of molding the results towards proving one pre-desired hypothesis.  Any scientist who does so is branded as a sham and generally stripped of his tenure/degree/etc.  This is known as the scientific method, and has been followed for centuries.  Wikipedia was designed to be laid out in a very cold and scientific manner, to dispense nothing other than actual facts about certain objects and entities.  It's not an arena for positing one's own spin on objects and entities.  If you don't like cold and non-biased data, then Wikipedia isn't the place for you.  I often go to entries on my favorite bands/movies/etc. (and I'm even talking about ones that have drastically changed my life, or bands that I like enough to have interviewed them in the past) and delete anything with even the tiniest whiff of favoritism.\n",

Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.\n",

A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said \"\"Lone Jogger\"\". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar \"\"robble robble.\"\" In \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,\"\" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and \"\"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald\"\"; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.\n",
      "Hamburglar 2015\n",
      "In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   \"\n",

On AlmostGrad's user page: \"\"I have a Conflict of Interest with Suburban Express stemming from my interactions with them on the UIUC subreddit.\"\" So she has established a link to Reddit. On Reddit, AlmostGrad100 has tirelessly posted unsubstantiated claims about Suburban Express. AlmostGrad100 seems to have catalyzed the very negative blog coverage that AlmostGrad repeatedly cites on Wikipedia talk page. As for AlmostGrad's recent addition to the talk page: I consider all false statements to be problematic, including the trivial examples which are cited in the most recent addition. The existence of trivial errors does not preclude there from being more significant errors, and there are. And I intend to enumerate those ASAP.

I think if you wish to write articles about fictional characters, it would be a good idea to review some of the Wikipedia guidelines for notability, such as Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)#Elements of fiction.

The pictures are missing from that link now however there are some here so there are two references to link to as evidence.  But at the moment I'm held up with another job. I'm no expert on trains and tunnels so if you feel like starting the page, let me know and I could weigh in and do just those bits of tidying which prevent new pages from being tagged and deleted. Don't know if you've started new articles yet - but the main tactic to avoid deletion is to have an intro that says \"\"Brunswick Tunnel is a so-and-so and it is notable for so-and-so\"\". We don't have pictures for the article, but we could get a photo of that plaque in Harrogate near Trinity church, and of the island in the road in Harrogate where the tunnel-end is underneath. There is more information here. But no pressure - just thought it might interest you. If nothing else it's a good read. Cheers.  \"\n",

Should i tell you that your act amounts to Vandalism in general ? Shall i tell you that even you upload in good faith it will be assumed as Vandalism only ? Being a honest wikipedian, how many times you could have reverted edits showing vandalism ? I didnt specify this because it is a general practice and moreover it would look a bit odd that a user like you indulged in Vandalism. So now i think you got your answer.

      "It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits.  I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television.  This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done.  I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof).  This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately.  Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar).  The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert.  Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others.  I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table.  Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).  Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.\n",

After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their \"\"Caucasoid traits.\"\" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry.

      "Remove – Entire article is of questionable notability. There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of \"\"not censored\"\" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a \"\"sheep shagger\"\" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of \"\"notability\"\". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of \"\"homophobia\"\" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a \"\"rocket\"\" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use \"\"not censored\"\" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an \"\"image filter\"\" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in \"\"behind closed doors\"\". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked \"\"dirty words\"\" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of \"\"no legal threats\"\", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this. COPPA stands a better chance, as child protection is of far greater importance than censorship, where there is limited parental control. WikiKamaSutra anyone?  [Chat • RFF] \"\n",

      "UNPRODUCTIVE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS or why the word \"\"PRACTISED\"\" is not the case of Lubitz's earlier actions. Very often people who intend to commit suicide have had many interrupted attempts to do it when \"\"suicidal impulse\"\" is not strong enough to overcome \"\"natural fear\"\" and \"\"resistance of rational thought\"\". For example, people trying to commit suicide with a gun often put the weapon to their head and then they interrupt this action moments before they pull the trigger. Viewed from the side, those unsuccessful suicide attempts are like theatrical act but this is just an illusion because every such attempt has the potential to end tragically. In the case of Lubitz - in the situation in which he intended to carry out his suicide there are several circumstances that limit his freedom of choice to interrupt the suicidal attempt - such as \"\"returning of the Captain\"\" or \"\"what you are doing in the cabin?!\"\". These circumstances can force his unproductive suicide attempts to became productive one in any moment and he knows that after them he will have no choice to turn back. For this reason it is \"\"normal\"\" he to do first timid attempts - which were unsuccessful in the first flight \"\"Duesseldorf to Barcelona\"\" because time is not limited. On his return back \"\"Barcelona to Duesseldorf\"\" the end destination is forcing him. As I said he has not \"\"PRACTISED\"\" but was \"\"TRYING\"\" to commit suicide or in other words - he had unproductive suicide attempt.  \"\n",

If one was to summarize it in one single sentence that would be the only way I can think of to describe it NPOV. NPOV though is somewhat nebulous with this book as we all have discovered because of the authorship, origin and unusual, unique presentation that has caused various types of POV to surface in debate - true, not true, religion, philosophy, etc. I searched in some online libraries, at the Library of Congress and even wrote to the Urantia Foundation to inquire about the history of its official categorization in hopes this would help. So far, I found it listed under scientific religion, religion, non-fiction, cults, and got lost with all the changes due to copyright issues and various changes in status at the LoC. The book itself says it is an epochal revelation, which is the fifth to the planet. It describes itself as clearing up misconceptions regarding God, deity, and divinity. Religious science, scientific religion, esoteric cosmology, religious cosmology, what? Perhaps just writing this in a paragraph would be useful. Answering this would help to streamline the rest of the article, while increasing it at the same time, I think. What are your thoughts?

      "Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said \"\"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly.\"\" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the \"\"torsion field\"\" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not \"\"just\"\" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that \"\"torsion\"\" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   \"\n",

However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they \"\"salt the earth\"\" so the article can never again be created.\n",

What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others.

It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.   \"\n",

There's a real mess with the species used in sushi; Japanese snapper claims that species is used, while Pagrus major says it is the species the Japanese common name \"\"madai\"\" is applied to. Meanwhile, izumidai redirects to northern red snapper, but is apparently a term for sushi-grade tilapia which is what most often appears as \"\"red snapper\"\" in Japanese restaurants in the US. \n",

A couple species are known as red snapper on the Pacific Coast of North America, and it appears that snapper is exclusive to a single species in Hawaii and New Zealand. Pretty much anywhere else in the world (Indian Ocean, Caribbean/western Atlantic, western Pacific), \"\"red snapper\"\" is hopelessly ambiguous (though most frequently refers to Lutjanus species)   \"\n",

      "Truth is I'm not as convinced as Livingston is that Arnold so easily believed in a transcendent God.  Nonetheless, this statement from a notable scholar (not to mention those of Ruth apRoberts) should make us stop short of a strong pronouncement one way or the other.  The eminent scholars are in a quandary on this one (and I am quite reticent to place myself in any category of eminence on this matter), surely their quandary is reason enough for us to look at least for some more qualified statement, and I mean to include by that my own substitute which no doubt also lacked sufficient qualification.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot lay my hands on it just now, but Arnold does say at one point, somewhat defensively, that he believes in God.  I think the problem is that Arnold's beliefs are not really so easily categorizable.  He makes it clear that Spinoza's thoughts appeal to him.  He also clearly states that he believes Spinoza was mis-judged in his time in being declared a heretic.  Part of our problem here might be that today we are so divorced from these older discussions of religion that we only see two alternatives: the belief in a transcendent, historical God, a God with physical attrributes; or no belief in God or anything that even remotely smacks of the metaphysical.  Our only possibility for a middle ground today may well be agnosticism (although, on a personal note, my own beliefs fall into the middle ground, and I would be insulted if anyone ever called me an agnostic, that however is not an argument that should have any relevance for the case with Arnold).  Arnold, I suspect, was quite comfortable dismissing superstition and setting aside metaphysical concerns, while still believeing in God.  The physicality or metaphysicality of that God were not relevant to the virtue they brought to Arnold and to his society.  In his own time he was accused of wanting to eat his cake and take it, too.  But he held out, and to my knowledge mever admitted the doubts that are implicit in agnosticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, I think with Arnold, Livingston overstates the case for him, he is not at the center of Protestant thought; Arnold really belongs to a middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of relgion and its virtues and values for society.  But to call him an agnostic probably places him in an aspect of the middle ground that he would never have felt comfortable inhabiting.  Sorry to offer no quotations.

      "\n",
      "I've been trying to figure out what happened with the AN/I report that led to a topic ban for WW. Normally, when the community makes a decision that requires admin tools to implement or enforce, there is a closing administrator. I've reviewed the report and have summarized it at User:Abd/Will ANI incident (at this point, this is a long summary, not a short one, I will prepare a short version if it's later needed.) And I just realized that there never was a close to that report, which explains why WW wasn't informed, that would normally be a task undertaken by a closing admin. Now, you later described the report as a consensus to topic ban, and you did inform WW, but you reported it passively, as if it had not been your decision, you were just the messenger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I easily understand how it happened, and assume nothing but good faith on your part, but there was a fundamental error here. The community does not make decisions by vote. Rather, it uses agents, public servants, who make decisions after review of community comment, but the servants are responsible for reviewing the arguments, and vote count isn't the issue except as a very rough guide, and I've seen many decisions, made by highly competent administrators, which ran directly contrary to a large majority of votes, based on a review of the arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I'm asking you if you did this. Did you review the arguments and decide that they were cogent and that a topic ban was in the best interests of the project. If you did not, would you do so now and \"\"close,\"\" i.e., take personal responsibility for the decision? In which case you could then inform us as to the length of the ban, or any other conditions imposed. And there would then be, if another administrator wishes to lift the ban, a responsible admin to contact?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell you that my now much more detailed review of the facts leads me to the conclusion that a ban wasn't justified at all, there was no disruption at DYK from Wilhelmina Will, and there was very minor misbehavior elsewhere which only gets connected with DYK because of her presumed motive. A general conclusion from those who understand DYK seems to be that there is nothing wrong with the motive, and that what WW did was simply some minor foolishness, of a kind that would normally pass almost unnoticed, and which she has not continued. So, in spite of her seeming disregard of warnings, she clearly hasn't disregarded them, she just quietly complied. Yes, she should learn to respond, it would help. But I have never seen a response to a warning as being a condition for not blocking. The procedure is Warn. Wait for repeated offense. Block if repeated. Not Warn. Wait for promise to comply. Block if no promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were several issues raised:\n",
      "Mesodermchelys misbehavior: short term, over one or two days, 2 improper reverts to preserve word count. 3 edit summaries that express her personal reaction to Blechnic  which, after reviewing what he had done, I fully understand and sympathize with. She was foolish to make those edit summaries, but it wasn't disruptive, and it wasn't personal attack within the meaning given at WP:NPA, whereas she was under repeated PA within that meaning: an attempt to damage her reputation.\n",
      "Copyright violations. Evidence was requested at ANI, but none was provided, links were given by Blechnic that showed nothing of the kind. He is now attempting to build a case on his Talk page  he now refers to all of her edits as crap, later amended to vandalism  and what he cited was a sentence in a seven-month-old article which, it turns out, she had noticed in the Sandbox and asked an admin if she could use it, and she failed to check for copyvio. The sentence was a direct copy. Maybe. Or was it that a web site later took the sentence from Wikipedia? I certainly don't know. Easy to fix. No pattern shown.\n",
      "Incivility. But the example given, as far as I recall, was always back to the Mesodermochelys incident. And then reference was made to her lying about it, claiming that her leetspeak comment was really a note to herself about something else. This was a clumsy excuse that simply shows that she is naive. And which was harmless, except to her own reputation.\n",
      "Accuracy of her articles. She has made mistakes. However, what I've seen with WW articles on scientific subjects is that, particularly if they are DYK nominated, whatever errors are in them are rapidly fixed. The articles aren't an obstacle to the creation of accurate content, rather they facilitate it, particularly by being DYK nominated. In other words, if there is, in fact, a problem here, DYK is part of the solution, not part of the problem. But, in fact, her articles are much better than the average new article on Wikipedia.\n",

On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves.

Knowing the number of revolutions per minute at which the propeller would be turning, they calculated the speed at which the blade would be moving at any point along its length and selected an appropriate airfoil from the tables developed during their wind tunnel tests. It sounds simple enough, but as Orville explained, \"\"on further consideration it is hard to find even a point from which to make a start, for nothing about a propeller, or the medium in which it acts, stands still for a moment.\"\"\"\", Tom Crouch, \"\"First Flight: The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Airplane\"\", pag. 57, 2002, https://archive.org/stream/firstflightwrigh00crou#page/56/mode/2up \n",

It shows a very clear understanding of some features of the question, but as the author seems unacquainted with negative tangential, and with the effect which weight of water acted upon by each part of the screw has in fixing the angle of incidence, the paper leaves much to be desired as a complete discussion of the subject. I am quite certain that his method of constructing a screw of uniform angle of incidence will not give the result intended. The speed imparted to the water by suction before the screw actually has a chance to strike it is also ignored; and no method of calculating the loss from this source is given.

      "(3) \"\"[2] Stefan Drzewiecki, born in 1844, was the originator of the blade element theory of screws, which considers the blades of a screw as being composed of an infinite number of aerofoil sections. The blade element theory, together with the momentum theory of Froude and Rankine, is almost universally used today to explain the action of aerial screws. In 1900, Drzewiecki presented a paper, \"\"Des Helices propulsives,\"\" to the Congres d'Architecture et de Constructions Navales in Paris. In 1901, a second paper by him, \"\"Du Choix des elements determinant les helices propulsives permettant leur facile comparaison entre elles,\"\" was published in the Bulletin de l'Association Technique Maritime (no. 12, 1901). The papers were reprinted in Paris in 1900 and 1901 respectively. It is not known which of the two Chanute sent to the Wrights.\"\", Source: http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/inventors/i/Wrights/library/Chanute_Wright_correspond/1903/Jul2-1903.html\n",

      "These two brothers were ignorant people, they made fun of Drzewiecki in front of Chanute, and finally, in 1908 when they flew in France and US in front of witnesses, started to claim the theory of this Polish scientist as their own. Historians, like Tom Crouch, who do not have any technical background, simply believed the two brothers and propagated this false information around the world.\"\n",

But I'll address the specific points you've made:\n",
      "While I didn't make the Mac Observer edit myself so I can't speak for the original editor, but I believe the point of the citation wasn't so much to make any particular point about the accuracy of Enderle's predictions (though I suppose that could be implied), but to point out how often Enderle has predicted Apple's failure, if not demise. Though more importantly, it illustrates that Enderle is target of criticism, deserved or otherwise. And I don't see how you could question the Death Knell Counter's credibility, when it links directly to cited articles. And I have no earthly idea why you quoted the policy on academic journals when we're talking about the validity of an internet site list (which itself is subject to scrutiny from the site's editors and readers).\n",
      "The operative term in the policy you quote is \"\"disproportionate\"\", which is to say, if an article's subject is subject of overwhelming criticism, than it makes sense for criticisms to dominate the article, and conversely, if the subject receives mostly praise, then it doesn't make sense for the article to be negative. But the way the article was before you erased the paragraph about the criticism seemed to be fairly balanced, with his accomplishments and prominence receiving the majority of coverage. And again, if he has his defenders/apologists, then feel free to cite them. Your edits aren't so much eliminating disproportionate criticisms, but whitewashing the article.\n",
      "I do not beleive that WP:NPOV gives a particular editor the right to outsource their WP:NPOV responsibility to another editor. - you clearly misunderstand the policy and the reason for my edits. Criticism against Enderle exists. Those criticism against Enderle come from prominent sources. Again, accurate or not, criticism from notable sources should be in the article. That you referred to Gruber as \"\"a John Doe\"\" suggests that you don't know enough about him to make any judgment about his notability, and your characterizing Gruber's criticisms of Enderle as \"\"personal attacks\"\" tells me you didn't read the cited posts carefully. \n",
      " The Gruber and Death Knell citations were properly sourced. They, in turn, linked to specific Enderle quotes that they criticize. You might not disagree with what they wrote, but they are not libelous, which is what the biography policy attempts to avoid. The policy you cite doesn't apply here. 98.204.112.111  \"\n",

Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go.\n",

      "It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following?\n",
      "1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass)\n",
      "2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system).\n",
      "3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer \"\"planetar\"\" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like \"\"moon\"\" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being \"\"satellites\"\". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?)\n",

      "Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that?   \n",

      "First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous \n",
      "Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem.    \n",

Maroon-bellied Parakeet is the name used by all major authorities that I know of, notably the South American Classification Committee (and therefore also AOU), Sibley & Monroe, Clements and Howard & Moore. It is also the name used in the recently published BIRDS OF THE WORLD Recommended English Names by Gill & Wright. Having spend considerable times in the field where it occurs, I have yet to hear anyone referring to it as a conure in these regions. This term is, as far as I know, strictly used in aviculture. I have seen the argument used that it, as well as other members of the genus Pyrrhura, are conures, but not parakeets (and it would therefore be wrong to call them parakeets), but this is wrong, as both groups as typically defined (see conure and parakeet) are polyphyletic.\n",

      "The '''Great Purge''' is the name given to the events of the late [[1930s]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when millions of people were arrested, about one million executed, and an estimated 12 million to sent to labour camps.  According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as \"\"anti-Soviet elements\"\" among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (\"\"Yezhov storm\"\"). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.\n",

Its appearance was neither exactly Roman, nor medieval, but largely sui generis, every ornament and gift the result of love.» (Brown: A Century for Cornwall; p. 98) The children's home is described in chapter 18 of Twenty Years.

Justice has finally been served, proving that the system here actually works, albeit slowly.

It is incredible to me that one user has caused such extensive damage and unending headache, heartache, and loss of resources. Yes, instead of spending hundreds of hours dealing with Gavin Collins' nonsensical, myopic, obtuse, elliptical, deconstructive, and dense argumentation, we could all have been making this a better place.

If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don't know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  also being censored are obamas ties to socialist and terrorist organizations.  He is affiliated with Ayers, who an uncover FBI agent recorded a dialog where Ayers group planned to kill 25 million americans who could not convert to socialism.  During the 1990 the socialist New Party listed him as a member.  His national security picks have ties to the chinese Government, and to the bin ladin Family.  And he seems cozy to opening up to socialist Cuba as well.  He has a harvard Law degree, his economic stimulus full of financing socialist and Keynesian polcies that will bleed the private sector dry while bankrupting our nation fiscally spending more and more money we don't even have and a debt we cannot repay, some newspapers have argued that obama's \"\"fix\"\" will cause a second depression.  So one might have to argue is a harvard law degree completely worthless, or if Obama plans to lead us down the road to destruction to nationalism and communism.  Not sure how the coffin workers bring paid in coffins will fair when everyone is starving to death, people will need food probably more than giving their loved ones a proper burial-if they don't resort to cannibalism.  If we can learn that he is illegal the constitution would then render all his laws, treaties, and executive orders are illegal and will be reversed and he can be stopped from ruining our great republic; if in deed he is legal then we as a nation are screwed.\"\n",

This is where the Americans clouded the definitions of state and nation that the rest of the world successfully differentiates.  The Constitution was the coming together of states that minted their own currency, engaged in trade wars with each other, refused to extradite criminals just because they happened to cross a state line, etc. into a \"\"Union\"\" hence how they became the \"\"United.\"\"  Up until the Civil War (especially in the South) is was thought that a state could easily withdraw if they didn't agree with the direction the Constitution was being torn into.  South Carolina attempted to get out in the 1830s, etc.  The Constitution of the United States of America is named as such simply because at first 13 states came together to agree to it.   This was at time when New England was thinking about leaving the Articles of Confederation and creating an entity from New York to Maine.  When sections of the American contintent west of the Appalachians were planning or trying to start their own little Republics (and some Kingdoms).  If the states hadn't come together and decided to lay down a new document for their confederation, and instead persisted after Annapolis to exist under the \"\"Articles of Confederation\"\" from 1775, most likely the union would have fallen shortly after 1800 (if not sooner) and today we would see maps with other more localized confederations of the 50 states (which who knows if there would even be 50).

      "Typically, when Xenophrenic sees a valid edit (by wiki policy) that he disapproves of (for whatever reason), he seeks to get others to remove it. This strategy is quite effective as he says the edit needs balance, or needs the proper context, or isn't the full story, etc. There are many different reasons used, but the end result is him adding so much trivial nonsense ( > 2 to 1 ratio in his POV) that average editors cringe when they see it. Xenophrenic then declares that the original unbalanced POV version can ONLY stay if his even more unbalanced additions are there to provide proper context. This leads to edit warring over days and even weeks, articles often get locked down. Some reasonable and responsible editors step in and remove it all in the name of peace and to move forward in improving the article. Xenophrenic gets what he wanted all along, and boosts his edit count with the disruptive edit warring. Some call this tactic a form of wiki-terrorism, I say it shows that Xenophrenic is quite calculated and intelligent, even though he is mostly obtuse during discussions. Talk \n",

He was very happy making contributions to what he believed to be a reputable encyclopedia. He worked as a journalist at a London based newspaper in the real world, and in the virtual world, Wikipedia was one of his many hobbies, where he edited this and that and made a small difference - so he liked to think. But then Derek made a huge mistake - when he tried to take on the cyber bullies - and  and came off the worse for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the afternoon of [[Monday[[ 7 April 2008. Derek had the day off work and was online and browsing Wikipedia. He happened to click on an article about the Radio 2 traffic presenter Sally Bowsman via the random articles button, and he noticed a piece of vandalism. Derek reverted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derek's next move was to look at who had added this piece of vandalism. He knew it was against Wikipedia rules to vandalise pages, so issued a user warning to the chap involved in the vandalism. Derek then decided he would keep an eye on this individual so that he might revert any more vandalism that  might commit.\n",
      "\n",

      "Things eventually got to the point where  had used up his four lives - that is, he had been issued with four user warnings; and still  continued to make disruptive edits. Derek therefore decided to approach WP:AIV and report this. Derek then looked at Tom's page history and discovered that he was a regular disruptive editor with rogue edits stretching back over a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user by the name of  promptly blocked the user. But two hours later, he had what can only be described as an attack of conscience and he unblocked .  didn't really give a reason for this about face other than that he had made a mistake. There then followed some discussion between Derek and Todd, and  even threw in his two penneth. Todd suggested Derek and Tom should chill out. Derek thought that a jolly good idea, and Derek even posted a friendly message on Tom's talk page urging him to make sensible edits - after all, unconstructive edits damage the reputation of Wikipedia, and the thing which damanges Wiki's reputation further is when rogue editors are allowed to continue making rogue edits willy nilly.\n",
      "\n",

Obviously those in Switzerland do not have any allegiance to the Italian Government, but it does not diminish their Italianess.  The ethnic Germans can be found across Europe, and many outside of Germany, but these people are ethnic Germans, identify as such, and most likely, have no allegiance to Germany.  \n",

      "The easiest solution, given how the English language works:  Make one page Laotian People (anyone from Laos, excluding Isan people and others) and make one page for Lao People, which includes Isan people.  Political allegiance to the Thai king does not mean that Isan people stopped eating sticky rice, listening to morlam, believe in Phaya Nak, celebrate Boun Phra Vet, think the Mekong River is sacred, or refer to themselves as Lao.  And Isan people have not stopped speaking the Lao language, it just got a name change.  The Isan language article has been vandalised, so to speak, with someone changing 'Isan' to 'Isan Lao'—most likely by a Lao person—since this nomenclature is absent in the speech of Isan people, who refer to themselves as 'Lao' or 'Isan' or 'Thai Isan'.  There is confusion between Thai and Lao culture, because it is almost the SAME!  Just like it's hard to tell Canadians and Americans apart, because, with the exclusion of the Québecois, people in Canada and America have the same culture, language, and share a border.  Laos and Thailand are no different.  The only thing that prevented Laos from being part of Thailand is the French, and the French are also the only ones that made the Isan people Thai, i.e., part of the Thai nation, but even the French were unable to stop Lao and Isan people from being a common people.  Isan was part of Lanxang just like Laos is, so both groups can claim access to the same heritage, influences, and what not.  Lao people make up only 50% of the population, in Isan, Lao speakers make up 88% of the region, so it is more homogenously 'Lao' than all of Laos!  Blame the French for the uneven distribution of the Lao people, but yes.  The Central Thai, i.e., Bangkok people and People of the Chao Phraya River valley, have worked very hard to integrate Isan into Thailand and claim Isan culture (which is Lao) as part of its cultural milieu.  There are also Lao that claim that the Thais have stolen from Lao culture, but since Thai and Lao (and Isan) are all descended from the same Tai peoples, of course there are similarities.  There were even Isan communists supporting integration of Isan into Laos up until the 1980s.  If the Isan people are not going to be listed as 'Lao People' than the following 'Lao' people should be removed because they are Isan by birth:\n",

I had first written an angry letter to Cyprus Today in order to complain about some of our professors resigning due to the economic problems in 2005. It was published along with two responses which completely overwhelmed me with such claims that TRNC diplomas are 'worthless pieces of paper' and one other going so far as to say that EMU is a 'zoo'. I then wrote a second letter to defend the university because I felt my intentions were taken advantage of. I wanted to complain not trash the university. The following summer I had some work expierence which was not too bad but I still felt a bit uncomfortable about this newspapers stand to North Cyprus higher education. I did an interview with the Rector at the time Prof. Dr. Halil Guven which was not published. The next summer I translated positive artices from the Press office at EMU for 2-3 months and again they were not published. To be honest I have not been following what they have been writing since then, but as soon as I read that this article was written at Cyprus Today I am now certain that this newspaper has a negative stand point on TRNC higher education therefore, I do not think they are a reliable source on these matters. They cannot present the story in an objective manner.\n",

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google \"\"South Ossetia War\"\". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title \"\"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA\"\" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the \"\"2008 Georgia War\"\" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased. Therefore the title stays, case closed.   \n",

Having made his own land prosperous, he set out in like manner to teach the other nations of the world. During his absence, the land of Egypt was so well ruled by his wife Isis, that his jealous brother Typhon (Set), the personification of evil, as Osiris was the personification of good, could do no harm in his kingdom; but on the return of Osiris to Egypt, Typhon made a conspiracy against him, persuading 72 other persons to join him, together with a certain Queen of Ethiopia named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at the time (74 altogether)...

The Cabal blocks people illegally, so the public is forced to employ other tactics to avoid the Cabal's finagling fingers.  Fortunately, the identities of the Cabal are now (at least, in part) being exposed.  Skomorokh, strangely, is holding back, perhaps fearful of losing control over his high-priority 'assignment'.  Actually, if Skomorokh were honest and ethical, he would by now either have weighed in on the subject, or he would have explicitly dissociated himself from the dispute.  (Rather than merely remaining silent.) And since most of the incorrect 'misinformation' on 'jim bell' originated from Skomorokh's edits, he should be willing to step aside and allow his errors to be corrected.      71.36.117.224  \"\n",

Why a comprehensive article about the Roman Empire wouldn't be one of the longest on Wikipedia is not a question I could answer, but my plan (as I can) is to spin off some of the longer sections into articles such as the one on the languages. I make no claim of comprehensiveness for the languages spinoff. I just tried to hit the major languages and regions. I believe Armenian is mentioned once in the Christian section. In general, I don't have a good feel for the Danubian provinces and the Balkans, so that was about the last thing I added, and almost forgot to. Meaning, I wasn't trying to write a GA or anything, and while I'll probably add a bit here and there as I encounter stuff to plug holes, I'll be turning to other topics.

(humiliatingly enough from my own lab...in the old days) that sets a good precedent for the en dash (though it is rarely used in modern lit.). The hyphenation stuff is the major point now.

The way that I met you was by catching you in the act of vandalism, and your initial response was to repeat the vandalism. It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals. I continued to monitor it because the vandalism had been common before I was able to get the article protected.

The reason I invited the wider view (mentioning that other political parties are involved in violence) is because it gives the reader a greater understanding of the elements at play.  Just as if one were to read about sea stars and there is a mention that they eat phytoplankton, mentioning that jellyfish also eat phytoplankton might be useful for greater understanding of the sea stars (are they in the same waters, do they compete for food).  To present this information as if CPI(M) members are singular in their violence is not a correct viewpoint if violence is ongoing between many parties.  In another example, if we were to present a fistfight between a man in a red shirt and a man in a white shirt, when they both were arrested for fighting... If we reported that as \"\"The man in the red shirt was striking the man in the white shirt repeatedly until eventually he was arrested.\"\" is not neutral because it gives undue weight to only one portion of a greater conflict, not informing the reader of all the information they could otherwise have.\n",

If Harmath is truly only supported by a single source, mentioning them unequivocally as a militant arm of the party based on that one source might be undue weight.  Saying \"\"One source claimed that an organization called Harmath is a militant arm...\"\" might be better, but we must take care not to use that as a gateway to simply reprint the article here.  If there is but one source, the weight that this should be given is likely minimal.  Does that properly speak to my viewpoints?  72.192.46.9  \n",

In the long run, it merits maybe 1 line here, and the rest should be in the Greer article. I was thinking it compares a bit with the Tom Cruise - Brooke Shields story, in which Cruise shot off his mouth about something he knows nothing about, post-partum depression. The difference is that Shields answered him, and it became a dialogue of sorts.

      "Since the Good Article review suggested that The Sims 3 expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing, my question is this, if we decide to split The Sims 3 games, i.e. core game with expansion and stuff packs, onto one listing, should we remove The Sims 3: Stuff Packs article and merge it into a new article with core / expansion pack / stuff pack article listing? I think the core / expansion pack / stuff pack article is wise, and thus, eliminating the stuff pack article (in my honest opinion) because we don't need two lists of stuff packs. So, this is a public vote! (and note the good article review is in the Archive 3 article page; see archive list above for link). Sundogs talk page sandbox\n",

      "There is some interesting stuff about the comparison between doing this prize with a mouse and doing it with fruitflies (drosophila). A couple of the more interesting points are that in a lab you can cheaply maintain and process larger numbers of fruitflies than mice, and the fruitfly lifespan is much shorter than the mouse lifespan so you get quicker feedback.\n",

      "Agree with Quiddity on both need for and choice of image for the lead.  Fully support expanding summary, but not by directly repeating content in the article.  Blackash, the page has not been vandalized.  With the exception of deleting a single reference that was neither intelligible nor functional, I was careful to keep all references both intact and with the statements they referenced.  If I missed any, it was unintentional.  If I somehow misconstrued their proper location, please set that right without adding back repetitive material.  I DID remove a LOT of repetitive material, particularly the direct repetition in the lead of two paragraphs from the article.  That's not summarizing. . I reorganized and consolidated a number of verbose, clunky, and grammatically incorrect sentences and paragraphs, in several sections, into concise statements and ideas that flow from one to the next, hopefully building and conveying the idea smoothly.  Word count is not a measure of informative content.  It's supposed to be a concise encyclopedic article about arborsculpture, now being referred to by consensus (this I assume) as tree shaping.  It's not a book. It's not supposed to be a how-to manual.  It's not \"\"battle of the sculptors and the finer fractional points of their methods,\"\" nor is it a debate on whose artistic technique is more pure, nor whose book is more popular or true, nor who sells more mirrors.  I strove for neutrality, well aware of the ongoing editing issues among the (IMO) way-too-involved author/editor/artist/arborists who currently monitor this page.  For just a single sticky example, waxing on about one's own (or someone elses) worldwide acclaim is not only not encyclopedic, it's unseemly.  It is made immeasurably more so by adding copious and ever-more-poorly formatted references to the insisted acclaim.  Further, there are several sections I haven't yet hammered at, that need it.  Most particularly the protracted sections comparing arborsculpture to (and from this reader's perspective, defending it from encroachment by) each and every other horticultural art & practice.  These sorts of writing read tensely and uncomfortably, like an argument, detracting from the fascinating topic. There may indeed be too many images for the text. Perhaps one exemplary image per artist is enough after all. ;)   \"\n",

      "How can it not be personal? Healthcare is about people's lives. Imagine if I was writing an article predominantly about the failings of allopathic medicine, of which there are still more than a few. Would it be a fair representation, and provide positive recommendations about the elements of allopathic medicine which could be trusted by those who may benefit from it? I am one of those people who has benefited from natural medicine in ways many GPs are still ill informed about. I had chronic hayfever that antihistamines could do little about without making me drowsy (I know they counteract it with stimulants now) due to boosting areas of my diet I rarely get a sniffle. Did a GP tell me about it? No. When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia I was given antipsychotic medication that stopped the voices, but induced symptoms of severe clinical depression and chronic fatigue which even the Psychiatrists who prescribed them failed to recognise as side-effects. Some time after when I told a state psychiatrist I was taking herbal medication he told me \"\"oh we're supposed to know about those sorts of things.\"\" There are also dietary changes that assist different mental illness which you won't get from many doctors. Now say I was a young lad again, and I was confronted with such ideas as you can't cure allergies with natural medicine, or that herbal medications are less effective. (A Joke. Some herbs are scheduled for a reason). Can you say that being discouraged from seeking the best qualified practitioner I could would be good for my health? Not that I'd go to wikipedia for that, at least not as anything more than an introductory paragraph or two and some further links. Call me naive, but I'd like to see a future where wikipedia can be relied upon as at least a good portal to reputable agencies, but there is no such place on wikipedia for Naturopathy in Australia, just as well in a way that the first two google searches, including the google definition of naturopathy come from the ANTA. Sure it'd be nice to have the first search as somewhere which offers a balanced critique, but no such place exists outside of reading long journal articles, and how many in the general public do that. Naturopathy is increasingly adopted by the general public in australia, you see it in mainstream pharmacies and in integrated medical practices now as well as health food shops and the call centres of vitamin companies. I'd prefer it to be the best quality possible, which is why I'm in favour of a critique of the more debatable therapies, and regulation which requires a high level of education. But nobody who's already interested in natural therapies is going to get much out of the wikipedia article as it is because they will see nothing but bias, and for people who are skeptical all it will do is agree with their skepticism. It challenges nobody, except the poor naturopathy student who wants it to be better.  \"\n",

Xeno apparently only saw that portion of the interview in which Susan actively argues with the insane man holding the hitler picture (as if that alone wasn't unprofessional). Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke. Seriously – it’s really long but well worth the read.

      "\n",
      "I would like to know when the Barelvis became a minority in Pakistan. It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be \"\"The people of the Sunnah\"\". Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?\"\n",

The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a \"\"porn actor\"\" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a \"\"porn actor\"\", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.

The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.\"\" \n",
      "Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as \"\"a prophet from the midst of thee.\"\" Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth. \n",
      "Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - \"\"altering\"\" the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this \"\"imitation\"\" and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: \"\"Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.\"\" There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.\"\" He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise. \n",
      "The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive \"\"from the midst of thee\"\" is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: \"\"I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.\"\" As it says: \"\"Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.\"\" Deuteronomy 13:1. \n",
      "\"\"A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.\"\" Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord\n",

I did not say it was a single book, but what you linked to says it is a 'corpus,' and it is often published at once, though apparently there is debate whether it was all written by Zoroaster.  At least for what Zoroaster wrote, I think philosophy does play a part, mostly involving semantics (difficult; knowing esoteric philosophy helps to interpret spiritually/divinely inspired texts) as you described, but perhaps also with gematria, or as HPB wrote, perhaps with 5 other methods than these latter 2.  Since many esoteric mystics have consensus on philosophy, not the least of which is ethics, methods of interpretation are important.  For example, such mystics would say animal sacrifice in the Avesta should not be done but is symbolic of something, as it is thought to be in the Vedas, etc..\n",

      "Bewafai is a Hindi film starring the First Superstar of Indian Cinema Rajesh Khanna[2][3][4][5][6] and the Superstar of Tamil film industry Rajnikanth together for the very first time[7].The film was directed by R. Thyagaarrajan.During the making of the Rajesh Khanna starrer super-hit film Haathi Mere Saathi(1971),the producer Dhandayuthapani was part of the crew of the film as the office administrator and R.Thyagarajan was the editor of the film.Later in the mid seventies R.Thyagarajan became a very successful director in Tamil cinema with every film directed by him becoming big hits and all those films had Rajnikanth[8] in it as the lead hero.The producer and the director duo could not get much success in Hindi cinema with their films becoming duds at the box office until this film released.The duo then decided to direct a movie in Hindi in 1985 and made a casting coup of sorts by casting Rajesh Khanna and Rajnikanth in the lead roles[9].Dhandayuthapani produced only four films[10] in Hindi with Bewafai being the most successful of them.\n",

      "This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party.\"\"  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand \"\"Nazi.\"\"  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no \"\"Nazi Party\"\" because it was actually the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party\"\" and the party members did not call themselves \"\"Nazis\"\" nor the \"\"Nazi Party.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the \"\"National Socialist German Workers' Party.\"\"  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a \"\"Nazi\"\" too, in that the term means \"\"National Socialist.\"\"  The term \"\"Nazi\"\" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  \n",

      "Wikipedia's cons use the term \"\"Nazi\"\" and the misnomer \"\"Nazi Party\"\" to cover-up the horrors of socialism.

They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.\n",

I don't apologise to people with such motives, or who serve protect themselves. The project only risks degenerating when sysop is left in the hands of people who abuse it. I maintain that the block is a front, a pretext. If reviewing admins are failing to take time to determine that and recognise the integrity of my claim, instead of taking Fram's for granted, which is contrary to \"\"we're all equals on wiki\"\", then I will have no choice but to raise the matter elsewhere, such as RfC or ArbCom. This isn't about discipline, at my age I don't consider \"\"you can't login\"\" as anything like you suggest, because it's not like losing wages. It's the principle of the matter. My contribs to WQA were meticulously used as spin against me, instead of the AGF everyone else saw them as. I don't intend to let Fram sit on a high horse any longer. Either they apologise first and withdraw their false assertions, or they'll have to explain them to RfC or ArbCom. Which I'm sure is much more complex and time consuming and stressful than admitting to any wrong-doing, but so be it, I stand for what I believe in and always have. I won't be bullied by someone like that. So really, the ball is in their court. If no one is counting coup, that applies to the admin who attacked me in an undignified manner, and continues to do so by maintaining their position – though now shielding themselves behind a wall of admins instead of facing up to the fact they erred. COI is clearly affecting their actions, or unwillingness to show face. They can either opt-in and admit they were wrong for their attack, or wait until a higher channel, one that even exceeds their stance, asks why they attacked my contribs and synthesised a despicable \"\"bad faith\"\" conclusion. The consequences this dispute have yet to be determined.  [Chat • RFF] \"\n",

If one sets ones sights low enough, and claim the goal of the operation was merely to establish a bridgehead, then it was a clear Soviet victory. However I seriously doubt the goal was only to gain a bridgehead, but rather to punch through the Panther Line, which the Soviets clearly failed to do. While the overall campaign was a clear strategic victory for the Soviets because they won the campaign in the end, it was a tactical victory for the Germans because they were successful in holding Narva even though it was not long lasting, i.e. six months.   \"\n",

Having read that it is very clear that my use of the Primary source was in absolutely the right way, and that Augustin's publicvation comes under the Novel interpretation category and is therefore minority view. The Primary source is not only clear it is also backed up by the commentary ( and therefore secondary source) offered by Hippolytus. As you may remember from history classes, a source is primary only where its comments are not upon a prior source (in which case they become secondary). It is therefore not possible to consider any commentary on a source still with us today as primary but only secondary. Josephus is thus both a primary and secondary source.

Can someone be an atheist, and yet still believe in some supernatural phenomena? Thoughts?   \"\n",

I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.\n",

As is typical in writings of that era, his history is flowery and wordy and doesn't give specifics about the research.  He does say that mid-Cardiganshire is \"\"particularly wealthy in the remains of early Celtic fortifications (source: \"\"What the Modern Corgi Owes to its Cardigan Ancestors,\"\" AKC Gazette, October 1935),\"\" and I can only guess that it's from these remains that the corgi has been dated.

      "Yes, true. I never used the term \"\"anti-vax\"\" term as it is perjorative (new word for me, but just the one I've been looking for), and for that reason you wont find anyone who is anti-vax describing themselves as such. It has always been thus, eg this 1895 book by Hutton \"\"Anyone who adopts the cause of the \"\"anti-vaccinator\"\" is, ipso facto, reckoned by a vast number of people—who on any other subject would judge fairly and patiently—a crank, a faddist, and a fool.\"\"  You can see this in front of your eyes by reading the page Midgley has created. You can see his intent by the way the more suitable and non-emotive term Vaccine Critics was deleted for this page.  He may believe sincerley that anti-vax are psychotic, but that doesn't make it OK. Also anti-vax are a small section of vaccine critics, so he is effectively deleting 90% of vaccine criticism.  And to get an idea about the term, I would have to ask people if they were happy to be termed \"\"anti-vax\"\", as I wouldn't list them as such otherwise.  15:37, 10\"\n",

      "if you doubt the subtle influence of your position as an admin, look no further than OWB's obsequiousness on your talk page. users know what the score is. i'm not going to play, and i've demonstrated repeatedly that my article editing here at wikipedia is in the top layer. i'm quite aware that many don't agree with my philosophy of human action and wikipedia's future (i.e., that encouraging disrupters and discouraging producers is a vacant policy), but i'm going to push it as far as it will go. it my theory begins by refusing to allow vandalistic interference in my comments, that's not necessarily something you couldn't support, katefan, you know. good editors could use the support of admins  far from the \"\"blitz onto the scene\"\" method where habitual disrupters and habitually superior editors are then treated as equal entities, with \"\"fresh start\"\" mantras (no, it's not the first time i've seen that from you, katefan) and an \"\"everybody's contributing equally\"\" approach that does nothing but swat the hands of editors who've fought, sometimes alone and for days, to preserve article integrity. doesn't work with children, nor with adults you're treating as children. the presumption of theoretical equality of action when arriving \"\"on the scene\"\" is probably the biggest mistake admins make here.\n",

OWB needed to face what he faced there, and wikipedia, and OWB, will be better off if this process isn't pretended away. you said something about \"\"i don't know what went on with you two\"\". really? all that went on was utterly public. i've had no private comm with OWB. so if you don't know what went on, then you didn't pay attention. if you're not paying attention, maybe you might consider stepping back and not jangling your admin keys so readily.\n",
